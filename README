Package to automatically hard-logout users in lab situations.

Computers can be set using the builtin tools to automatically logout users
after a predetermined amount of time. However, it will wait, and ultimately
fail, if a user has open tabs in Safari (no longer true), unsaved changes in an
Office document, etc.

I tried numerous ways of doing this-the first idea was to killall -9
loginwindow, but, that frequently left users with a glitched out loginwindow
(Go figure...)

So I eventually decided to just reboot the computer. Of course, this requires
a change to the sudoers file, which is why there is a postflight script.

This is meant to be built with The Luggage, but can certainly be built in other
ways.
