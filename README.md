Package to automatically hard-logout users in OS X computer labs.

Computers can be set using the builtin tools to automatically logout users
after a predetermined amount of time. However, it will wait, and ultimately
fail, if a user has unsaved changes in an Office document, etc.

I tried numerous ways of doing this-the first idea was to ```killall -9
loginwindow```, but, that frequently left users with a glitched out loginwindow
(Go figure...)

So I eventually decided to just reboot the computer. Of course, this requires
a change to the sudoers file, which is why there is a postinstall script. Please take note! As configured, this will allow *any* user to reboot or shutdown the computer using the commandline ```reboot``` and ```shutdown``` commands.

If the computer has a power schedule, and the machine is past the scheduled shutdown time, it will just shut down instead of reboot.

There are a few variables that you can adjust to suit your environment:
* You can set the number of seconds after which a system is considered to be idle. Edit the ```MAXIDLE``` constant at the top of autoLogout.py. (Configured for 30 minutes).
* You can set the number of seconds a user has to cancel the auto logout. Edit the ```LO_TIMEOUT``` constant at the top of autoLogout.py. (Configured for 60 seconds).
* You can change the interval after which the LaunchAgent runs. Just edit the ```StartInterval``` value in the org.da.autoLogout.plist file. (Configured for execution every 5 minutes).

This is meant to be built with The Luggage, but can certainly be built in other
ways. If you're happy to just use it as is, the releases section has a prebuilt package.
